          a. Right to Control Content. CrowdCoverage may, but is not required to, monitor or control the Content posted via the Services. Our failure to exercise this right does not give you any right to make a claim against CrowdCoverage. Any Content that has been uploaded through the Services may be deleted at any time without notice to you.
          </p>
        <p>
          b. Right to Discontinue the Services. The Company reserves the right to discontinue the Services, retract COVR tokens, or to change the Services in any way and at any time, with or without notice to you, without liability.
          </p>
        <p>
          c. Right to Terminate User Access. CrowdCoverage reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services without notice and, if you violate this Agreement, to pursue other remedies at law or in equity. We may delete your account for any reason or for no reason at all, and if we delete your account you will lose all access to any information, connections or other features that may have value to you that may have been associated with your account.
          </p>
        <p>
          d. Right to Refuse or Cancel Registration. The Company has the right to refuse registration of or cancel your user account in its discretion for any reason or for no reason. In addition, the Company reserves the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services and to terminate users and/or reclaim usernames. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Agreement (including investigation of potential violations hereof), (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of CrowdCoverage, its users and the public.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you specifically acknowledge that the Company is exempt from liability to any person for any claim based upon its termination of an account or disabling of access to or removal of any Content, including material it believes, in its sole discretion to violate this Agreement, regardless of whether the material ultimately is determined to be infringing or otherwise prohibited, and regardless of whether such termination or disabling has the effect of reducing the value of any Content or opportunities that might otherwise have been available to you. By using the Services, you agree that notice to you through an email to the email address you provided in your profile constitutes reasonable efforts to notify you of any removal or disabling if such notice is required.
          </p>
        <p>
          f. Comments, Feedback, Suggestions, Ideas, And Other Submissions.

          </p>

          a. Identify the material on our site that you claim is infringing, with enough detail so that we may locate it on the website;
          </p>
        <p>
          b. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;

          </p>
        <h2>XI. RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          CrowdCoverage provides an execution-only service and does not advise on the merits of any particular transactions or their tax consequences. As a general matter, Users should be aware of the following prior to utilizing our Services.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>a. Trading Tokens can be extremely risky.</strong> Each particular Token has a unique feature set that makes it more or less likely to fluctuate in value. In addition, factors beyond CrowdCoverage’s control may affect market liquidity for a particular Token, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, or unexplainable price volatility. Blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, hard forks, or a number of other unforeseeable reasons. CrowdCoverage does not assume the risk of losses due to trading or due to factors beyond its control regarding the viability of specific blockchain networks. As a general matter, we advise Users with limited experience and low risk tolerance not to engage in the purchase of Tokens. Speculating on the value of Tokens is high risk and Users should never trade more than they can afford to lose.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b. Understanding Tokens requires advanced technical knowledge.</strong> Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a Token on CrowdCoverage does not indicate approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding any Token, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Token. We give you no warranty as to the suitability of the Tokens traded under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c. You accept the risk of trading Tokens.</strong> In entering into any transaction on the Platform, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the transaction and the underlying Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction or any underlying Token.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>d. You are responsible for complying with applicable law.</strong> You agree that CrowdCoverage is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax law and whether you are legally permitted to buy or sell cryptocurrency. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Services.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>e. You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges.</strong> CrowdCoverage may experience sophisticated cyberattacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions in the Service. You understand that the Service may experience operational issues that lead to delays on our platform. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold CrowdCoverage accountable for any related losses.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>f. CrowdCoverage does not advise on investment risk.</strong> If at any point CrowdCoverage or its representatives do provide investment recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no obligation of truth or due diligence on behalf of CrowdCoverage or its representatives.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>g. CrowdCoverage is a regulated entity and must comply with applicable law. Applicable law, regulation, and executive orders may require CrowdCoverage to, upon request by government agencies, freeze withdrawals or trading (or both), or provide information regarding your account. Further, our recordkeeping and customer verification procedures are subject to change at any time as required by law or industry practices. We must comply with the law and you accept any inconveniences to you or other consequences resulting from our compliance.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>h. Users accept all consequences of sending Tokens to an address off our platform.</strong> Token transactions may not be reversible. Once you send Tokens to an address, you accept the risk that you may lose access to your Tokens indefinitely. For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be discovered, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return your Tokens, or an address belongs to an entity that may return your Tokens but first requires action on your part, such as verification of your identity.
          </p>
        <h2>XII. ATTACKS ON BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS</h2>
        <p>
          CrowdCoverage does not have any ability to prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks, including the Ethereum network. With respect to its platform, CrowdCoverage reserves the right to take the following commercially reasonable actions in the event of an attack: (i) If CrowdCoverage is able to confirm that a Token active on the Platform has been compromised or is under attack, CrowdCoverage may immediately halt the sale or withdrawals for such Token; (ii) if it is determined that such an attack caused the Token to greatly decrease in value, CrowdCoverage may discontinue trade activity on such Token entirely. CrowdCoverage does not have any obligation to engage in activity in relation to attacks on blockchain networks. CrowdCoverage makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of the Platform and is not liable for any lost value or stolen property, whether or not CrowdCoverage was negligent in providing the proper security.
          </p>
        <h2>XIII. LIMITED LICENSE; FEES</h2>
        <p>
          CrowdCoverage grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license, subject to these Terms, to access and use the Services, and the content, materials, information, and functionality available in connection therewith (collectively, the “Content”) solely for information, transactional, or other approved purposes as expressly permitted by CrowdCoverage from time to time.

You authorize CrowdCoverage to deduct any applicable fees from your Account at the time you make a given transaction. Changes to the fee schedule are effective as of the date set forth in any revision and will apply prospectively from that date forward.
          </p>
        <p>
          CrowdCoverage does not, as a general rule, participate in promotions without an official pronouncement, either on our Site or elsewhere. You promise to obtain prior written approval prior to releasing any statements, written media releases, public announcements and public disclosures, including promotional or marketing materials, relating to CrowdCoverage.
          </p>
        <h2>XIV. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICY</h2>
        <p>CrowdCoverage protects itself from involvement in any activity that facilitates money laundering or other criminal activities by following FinCEN guidance and applicable laws concerning AML and KYC procedures.</p>
        <p>CrowdCoverage aims to reasonably identify each User and/or purchaser of COVR tokens by asking them to provide their name and email address and possibly other or additional information as part of its AML and KYC policies. Under some circumstances, users may choose to give incorrect information.</p>
        <p>If a User or a User’s transaction is flagged as suspicious through our internal controls, CrowdCoverage will require additional proof of identification from the User and has the right to not permit any activity on the APP or Site until additional and verifiable proof of identity satisfactory to CrowdCoverage in its sole discretion is received and CrowdCoverage has approved the User for use of the Platform.</p>
        <p>
          By agreeing to our Terms, you acknowledge and understand that CrowdCoverage maintains verification levels which require User participation and verification in order to obtain, with leveled permissions based on User-supplied information, our ability to verify it, and our internal policies. You accept that you may not be able to achieve a desired level of verification, and CrowdCoverage reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, the appropriate verification level and criteria for any User, as well as the right to downgrade Users without prior notice.
          CrowdCoverage may, from time to time, implement policies restricting verification levels and criteria by nationality, country of residence, or any other factor.
          This may affect your ability to withdraw Tokens and you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless CrowdCoverage against any losses associated with an inability to deposit and/or withdraw Tokens based on the verification level assigned by CrowdCoverage to your Account.
          </p>

          </p>
        <h2>XVII. DISPUTES WITH OTHERS</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor and/or manage disputes between you and other users of the Services. If you have a dispute with other users, you release the Company and hereby agree to indemnify the Company from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of, or in any way connected with, such a dispute.
          </p>
        <h2>XVIII. ARBITRATION</h2>
        <p>
          a. Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and the Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other, sent by certified mail (with return receipt). The Company will send its notice to your address as set forth in the books and records of the Company, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the email address provided by you in connection with your use of the Services.
          </p>
        <p>
          b. Binding Arbitration at Option of Either Party. If you and the Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration. This Agreement, including all Disclaimers, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Nevada, excluding that body of laws known as choice of law or conflict of laws. Subject to the provisions of this Section all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration conducted in Clark County, Nevada before an arbitrator affiliated with the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules; and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
          The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration (the "AAA Rules"), subject to the provisions of this Section. The terms set forth in this Agreement will control in the event of any inconsistency between such terms and the AAA Rules. The parties will cooperate with AAA and with each other in promptly selecting a single arbitrator from AAA's panel of neutrals. If the parties fail to so select an arbitrator within thirty (30) days following the date of either party's notice of demand to conduct arbitration, then AAA will appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.
          Judgment on the arbitrator's award will be final and binding upon the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If for any reason AAA or its successor no longer is in business, then the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the JAMS.
          The arbitrator's fees will be shared equally by the parties and each party will bear its own costs and attorneys' fees. All papers, documents, or evidence, whether written or oral, filed with or presented in connection with the arbitration proceeding will be deemed by the parties and by the arbitrator to be confidential information of both parties.
          The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from applying for and obtaining from a court a temporary restraining order and/or other injunctive relief.
          Any and all disputes regarding the content presented on this site must be resolved through arbitration as set forth in this section.
          You and the Company agree that you may not bring any Dispute in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services or any other persons.
          You and the Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the Company’s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.
          </p>
        <p>
          ADDITIONALLY, YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. If a court or federal regulator with oversight over CrowdCoverage decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and CrowdCoverage's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.
          </p>
        <h2>XIX. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>a. Injunctive Relief.</strong> You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made hereunder to the Company are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm the Company and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone, so that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any).
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b. Export Controls. </strong> Certain information provided by Customers or Insurers may be subject to U.S. export controls. Thus, no such materials may be downloaded, exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List. By downloading any material available through the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list. The parties specifically disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

The information provided on or through the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject the Company to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.

          <strong>e. Venue and Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement and all aspects of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the United States and the State of Delaware governing contracts entered into and to be fully performed in Delaware (i.e., without regard to conflict of law’s provisions) regardless of your location except that Section VIII (Arbitration) of this Agreement shall be governed as indicated therein. For the purpose of any judicial proceeding to enforce an arbitration award or incidental to such arbitration or to compel arbitration, or if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts sitting in Clark County, Nevada, and agree that service of process in such arbitration or court proceedings shall be satisfactorily made upon a party if sent by certified, express or registered mail addressed to it at the address set forth in the books and records of the Company, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the email address provided by the relevant party to the Company in connection with its use of the Services. With respect to any Disputes not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth above), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada. To the extent non-U.S. laws mandate a different approach with respect to governing law, venue, statute of limitation, and dispute resolution method with respect to certain non-U.S. persons, each such required standard shall be applied, but all other provisions under this section shall remain in full force.
          </p>

          <strong>f. Waiver and Severability.</strong> The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. In fact, the Company may choose to enforce certain portions of this Agreement more strictly or to interpret certain provisions more strictly against certain users than it does against users in general, and such disparate treatment shall not be grounds for failing to comply with all this Agreement as so interpreted.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>g. Unenforceability.</strong> You and the Company agree that if any portion of this Agreement, except any portion of Section VIII (Binding Arbitration at Option of Either Party) is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall continue to be in full force and effect. If Section VIII is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither you nor the Company will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section VIII found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Clark County, Nevada, and you and the Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
